# Introduction

## Context:
The incorporation of AI into healthcare has transformed medical diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods face limitations, especially with complex diseases. AI techniques, particularly machine learning, offer advanced solutions by processing large datasets to uncover intricate patterns. This thesis focuses on disease prediction using AI models, specifically the Random Forest classifier.

## Aim:
The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the Random Forest classifier in predicting a wide range of diseases based on a set of symptoms.

## Objectives:
- Optimize the dataset for accurate prediction.
- Implement the Random Forest model for disease classification.
- Evaluate model performance through precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
- Conduct a comparative analysis with existing models.
- Explore the potential impact of this AI model on healthcare systems.

## Research Questions:
1. How does the Random Forest model perform compared to other machine learning models in predicting diseases?
2. What are the key symptoms that impact disease prediction accuracy?
3. How can the model be optimized for better real-world application in healthcare?
