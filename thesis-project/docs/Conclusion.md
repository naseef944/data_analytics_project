# Conclusion

## Key Findings:
The Random Forest model is highly effective in disease prediction, achieving high accuracy and reliability in classifying diseases based on a large set of symptoms. It outperformed other models like KNN and Decision Tree in comparative tests.

## Implications for Healthcare:
AI models like Random Forest could greatly enhance disease prediction and resource allocation in healthcare systems. However, challenges such as model interpretability and computational demands must be addressed.

## Future Work:
Further research should focus on improving model scalability, addressing ethical concerns, and testing the model on more diverse, real-world datasets. Integrating other machine learning techniques such as deep learning could also be explored.
