# Literature Review

## AI in Healthcare:
AI has revolutionized healthcare by enabling personalized medicine and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Key AI advancements include diagnostic imaging and patient-specific treatment planning. However, challenges such as ethical concerns, data privacy, and resistance to adoption remain.

## Disease Prediction Models:
Current models, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, have shown promise in disease prediction, but they often lack the interpretability required in clinical settings. Random Forest offers a balance between performance and explainability, making it a suitable candidate for disease prediction.

## Ethical Considerations:
AI in healthcare raises ethical issues, including biases in algorithms, patient consent, and data security. These concerns must be addressed to ensure that AI systems are fair and transparent.

## Global Perspectives:
AI adoption in healthcare varies globally, with developed nations leading the way. Developing countries face barriers such as limited infrastructure and training, which slow AI implementation.
