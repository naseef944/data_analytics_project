# Abstract

This dissertation explores the intersection between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and healthcare, focusing on disease prediction. The research evaluates the effectiveness of the Random Forest classifier in predicting 43 diseases using 132 symptoms from a Kaggle dataset. Through optimizing the dataset, implementing the model, and performing a detailed performance evaluation, this study provides insights into the potential and limitations of AI-assisted disease prediction. The findings suggest that Random Forest is a promising tool for healthcare systems, but improvements are needed for scalability and broader application in real-world settings.
